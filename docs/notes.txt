2.Custom URL for My Web App

Domain name services (DNS) let me assign a unique URL to my web app by linking a domain name to its IP address. 
Most users manage this easily through an interface while the service handles the technical details. Although my app already has a URL, 
using a custom domain would enhance its professional look, even with added cost.

	How do I pick a good URL name when the seemingly good ones are expensive?

  Dynamic IPs change all the time how does the DNS keep up with the changing of IPs?
